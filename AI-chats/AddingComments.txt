Done! I've added comprehensive comments throughout app.py to explain:

Imports section: What each library does
Main function: Purpose of the function
Differential Equations section: Identifies Part 1 content
Linear Regression section: Identifies Part 2 content
Sidebar parameters: Explains data generation and model hyperparameter controls
Data generation: Details the data generation process and flow
Model training: Documents the training procedure
Results visualization: Explains each metrics display and visualization section
Entry point: Clarifies the script's execution point
The comments now provide clear documentation of the code's structure, making it easier to understand what each section does and how the application flows.
